# Milestone 1

## Overview 
This milestone within our project focuses on a hands-on approach to understanding and implementing a neural network using the MNIST dataset. The primary goal is to checkout (download) the `mnist_convnet.py` script, execute it on our machines, and propely document our processes and findings. 


## Folder Structure
- **milestone_1**: This folder consits of the following files:
    - mnist_covnet.py: contains the code used for this milestone and it also automatically downloads the data.

    - report.md: this is a markdown file containing all the processes, findings and challenges faced during the this milestone properly logged.

    - requirments.txt: this file contains all the neccessary libraries needed to sucessfully run mnist_covnet.py
