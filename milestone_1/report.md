## Introduction
This milestone uses the MNIST dataset which is short for "Modified Natioanl Institute of Standards and Technology".[1] MNIST was constructed from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Database 3 (SD-3) and Special Databse 1 (SD-1)by remixing the samples which were taken from American Census Bureau employess and high school students.[2] This dataset contains a massive collection of handwritten digits used to train various image processing systems and it is one of the most popular image recognition dataset.

** The goal of this milestone is to checkout('download') the mnist_covnet.py code, run it on our machines and report our processes and findings. **

## Dataset Overview

### Nature of the problem
This is a **classification problem** because we discovered that the model learns to classify images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

### Dataset Characteristics
**Size:** The dataset is a collection of 70,000 handwritten digits (0-9), having 60,000 training images with their labels and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits with their corresponding labels as well to evaluate the performance of the traained model.

**Type of Data:** It consits of 784 grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels. Each pixel value (0-225) represents the grayscale intensty of the corresponding pixel in image with 0 representing white and 225 representing black.[2]
